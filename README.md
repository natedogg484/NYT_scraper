# NYT_scraper
Scrapes articles from https://www.nytimes.com/ with the click of a button. Provides a direct link to the article if the user wants to read the full thing, and allows the user to make a comment on the article based on what they have read.

## Getting Started

Simply click on the scrape button to load articles on the page. Titles, Summaries, and a link will appear. Click the summary to make a comment, and click the link to go to the site. The links may be broken(now), so you may need to delete 'class=' at the end to load the page. It is very annoying and wasn't happening before. I apologize
